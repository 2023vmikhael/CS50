# collection of notes in the C language

Scratch:   Say(hello, world)

```C
printf("hello, world\n");
```

All printed words are called strings and strings are enclosed by "string"; <br>
\n tells computer to start a new line; <br>
The ; is like the period at the end of the sentence. It tells the computer that this is the end of the statement; <br>

Scratch: set counter to 0

```C
int counter = 0; 
```

In C, you must declare the type of variable you are creating;

Scratch: change counter by 1;

```C
counter = counter+1 #add any number to counter;
counter=1 #only add plus 1 to a counter;
counter++ #only adds plus 1 to a counter;
```

In CS, a single = (equal sign) doesn't mean "equals", it means "assign" or is basically the psuedo "GET."

Once you've told the computer a certain direction, you don't need to repeat it because it's been told already;

if (x<y) 

{
  printf("x:
  };
  
  if (x<y)
  {
    printf("x is less than y\n");
    }
    else
    {
      printf("x is not less than y\n);
      
      {, } are reffered to as "curly brace"

if (x<y) 
{
  printf("x is less than y\n);
  }
  else if (x>y)
  {
    printf("x is greater than y\n);
    }
  else if (x==y)
  {
    printf("x is equal to y\n);
    }
    
    Two equal signs creates patterns of symbols to represent equality;
  
  C uses the word "while"
  
  Example: while
  {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    }
  
  When a forever loop is needed, you need to use the word "while" because in C it is less directly translated;
  
  In most cases, spaces between words in code don't really matter, but some cases do require spaces;
  
  Example: while (true)
  {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    }
    
    Languages like C don't offer the "repeat [insert number] time" newer languages like Scratch do;
  
  How the repeat is used in C;
  
  for (         )
  {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    }
    
    Computers start counting from 0, unlike humans, because it's binary;
    
  You can't have spaces in names of functions in C, so instead of spaces humans decided to use underscores;
  
  Example of asking a question while coding:
  
  get_string("What's your name?\n");
  
  Example of an answer;
  
  answer=get_string("What's your name\n");
  
  Variables are involved a lot on a script;
  
  You can't use the same variable twice because computers can't be told what to do more than once;
  
  Directories= name for folder
  
  RMDIR= Remove Directory
  
  RM= Remove
  
MV= move

MKDIR= make directory (new folder);

CD= change directory;

{
  printf("hello, world\n");
  }
  
  Source Code (C, Java, C++, Python,ect);
  
  Machine Code= binary (0s and 1s);
  
  Complier= the input of the source code, the putput of the machine code;
  
  Clang= messages that are blinking, using a dollar sign ($); 
  
  Linux= CS system like Windows and Mac (free operating system);
  
  $ clang.hello.c;
  $ ./a.out;
  
  This runs the a.out^^;

Command line environment= fancy way of saying comands (tells the computer how to behave);

errors usually occur during IDE;

"clear then enter", clears the whole script;

use a percentage (%) to tell the program that the letter in front of it is a integer and not a word;

"./" runs the program;

interger: [insert number];

"#include" includes the command you give in the coding;

variables "x and y" are used in C;

an integar has no decimal point;

"%f" cuts of the decimal places;

Adding a double slash(//) on top of a line of code is a comment;

Double lines mean "or" || (c code for or);

An explanation point (!) means not equal to in C;
