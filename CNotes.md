# collection of notes in the C language

Scratch:   Say(hello, world)

```C
printf("hello, world\n");
```

All printed words are called strings and strings are enclosed by "string"; <br>
\n tells computer to start a new line; <br>
The ; is like the period at the end of the sentence. It tells the computer that this is the end of the statement; <br>

Scratch: set counter to 0

```C
int counter = 0; 
```

In C, you must declare the type of variable you are creating;

Scratch: change counter by 1;

```C
counter = counter+1 #add any number to counter;
counter=1 #only add plus 1 to a counter;
counter++ #only adds plus 1 to a counter;
```

In CS, a single = (equal sign) doesn't mean "equals", it means "assign" or is basically the psuedo "GET."

Once you've told the computer a certain direction, you don't need to repeat it because it's been told already;

if (x<y) 

{
  printf("x:
  };
  
  if (x<y)
  {
    printf("x is less than y\n");
    }
    else
    {
      printf("x is not less than y\n);
      
      {, } are reffered to as "curly brace"

if (x<y) 
{
  printf("x is less than y\n);
  }
  else if (x>y)
  {
    printf("x is greater than y\n);
    }
  else if (x==y)
  {
    printf("x is equal to y\n);
    }
    
    Two equal signs creates patterns of symbols to represent equality;
  
  C uses the word "while"
  
  Example: while
  {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    }
  
  When a forever loop is needed, you need to use the word "while" because in C it is less directly translated;
  
  In most cases, spaces between words in code don't really matter, but some cases do require spaces;
  
  Example: while (true)
  {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    }
    
    Languages like C don't offer the "repeat [insert number] time" newer languages like Scratch do;
  
  How the repeat is used in C;
  
  for (         )
  {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    }
    
    Computers start counting from 0, unlike humans, because it's binary;
    
  You can't have spaces in names of functions in C, so instead of spaces humans decided to use underscores;
  
  Example of asking a question while coding:
  
  get_string("What's your name?\n");
  
  Example of an answer;
  
  answer=get_string("What's your name\n");
  
  Variables are involved a lot on a script;
  
  You can't use the same variable twice because computers can't be told what to do more than once;
