# collection of notes in the C language

Scratch:   Say(hello, world)

```C
printf("hello, world\n");
```

All printed words are called strings and strings are enclosed by "string"; <br>
\n tells computer to start a new line; <br>
The ; is like the period at the end of the sentence. It tells the computer that this is the end of the statement; <br>

Scratch: set counter to 0

```C
int counter = 0; 
```

In C, you must declare the type of variable you are creating;

Scratch: change counter by 1;

```C
counter = counter+1 #add any number to counter;
counter=1 #only add plus 1 to a counter;
counter++ #only adds plus 1 to a counter;
```

In CS, a single = (equal sign) doesn't mean "equals", it means "assign" or is basically the psuedo "GET."

Once you've told the computer a certain direction, you don't need to repeat it because it's been told already;

if (x<y) 

{
  printf("x:
  };
  
  if (x<y)
  {
    printf("x is less than y\n");
    }
    else
    {
      printf("x is not less than y\n);
      
      {, } are reffered to as "curly brace"
